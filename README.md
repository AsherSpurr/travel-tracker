# Travel Tracker week 11 solo project
A site for users to quickly track their excursions and book new trips.

### Background 
This web application was created as a simple one-stop shop to book and track travels. As a user I should be able to see previous trips as well as pending trips awaiting approval. I can book a new trip easily with the planning form.

### Next steps 
Additional enhancements could include:
- Incorporate Google user authorization for real people to use
- Adjust accessibility features to account for keyup & down events 
- Incorporate more robust error handling for all cases
- Re-factor starting functions based on best practice

### Accessibility
To assess the app's accessibility, I used extensions such as WAVE, Lighthouse, and Colorblind to look for areas of improvement. I also ensured that the user could tab through the app without using a mouse and that a screen reader could effectively navigate through the site. Currently, The accessibility score is 100% according to Lighthouse.
